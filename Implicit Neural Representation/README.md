A Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) finds optimal nonlinear basis functions to represent data in an end-to-end manner. Implicit neural representations (AKA coordinate-based representations) are a novel way to parameterize signals of all kinds. Conventional signal representations are usually discrete - for instance, images are discrete grids of pixels, audio signals are discrete samples of amplitudes, and 3D shapes are usually parameterized as grids or voxels, point clouds, or meshes. In contrast, Implicit Neural Representations parameterize a signal as a continuous function that maps the domain of the signal (i.e., a coordinate, such as a pixel coordinate for an image) to whatever is at that coordinate.
